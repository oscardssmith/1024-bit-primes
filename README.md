# 1024-bit Primes

Rust code to generate 1024-bit primes including implementations of [arbitrary precision arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic) and [Miller-Rabin Primality test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test). It accompanies my article on the same topic - [https://glitchcomet.com/articles/1024-bit-primes](https://glitchcomet.com/articles/1024-bit-primes).  

Do not use in production or cryptographically secure applications unless you know what you are doing.
